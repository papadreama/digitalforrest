I'd like to begin by laying out my intentions and personal interest in creating and teaching this course. This course is intended to fulfill the "reflection" requirement for the Honors Program. Reflection is not always well-incentivized by our academic and professional cultures. Even though we see more and more self-care-related content online, extolling the virtues of practices like meditation and journaling, it can be hard to muster the will or discipline to engage in these kinds of practices outside of our many responsibilities and the pace at which we're expected to meet those responsibilities. So, with this course, we have some incentive and some time carved out to see what we might gain from such practices and to do so in a structured and collaborative setting.
